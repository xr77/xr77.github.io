								<b>All about math</b><br>One project that I am currently working on is to apply both neuroimaging and behavioral measurements to assess the symbolic integration process of number knowledge.
								By correlating neuroimaging data and behavioral measurements, 
								I am trying to characterize the underlying neural pathway that contributes 
								the basis of symbolic integration and its influence on math ability.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Application of wavelet transform in fMRI data</b><br>Another project that I am currently working on is to understand how our brain encodes information across multiple scales using a novel analysis method called wavelet transform. 
								Wavelet transform has often been used in image analysis bur rarely in fMRI data analysis. This is possibly due to the limitation of conventional methods such as "spatial smoothing"
								,which cannot define the spatial scales rigoriously. Our results indicated that the visual stimuli can be represented on different spatial scales in the brain, which has broad implications in our understanding of the brain. 
								This study is one of the first successful attempts of applying the wavelet to analyze fMRI data.

								<b>Sleep and memory </b><br>How does sleep affect memory representations qualitatively? In one of my studies, we focused on addressing this problem with a new technique called latent semantic analysis (LSA) 
								to quantitatively evaluate the impacts of sleep on memory. Our results revealed that sleep can affects memory representations qualitatively by reducing semantic coherence, 
								which has important implication in sleep and memory studies.
